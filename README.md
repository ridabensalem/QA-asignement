# QA backend -asignement
Here’s a simple coding test that evaluates a candidate’s problem-solving skills, knowledge of backend development, and understanding of microservices-related tasks. It focuses on testing the logic and approach to common backend scenarios.

### **Coding Test: Simple REST API**

**Objective:**  
Build a simple REST API with two endpoints that simulate interaction between microservices. The API should handle adding and retrieving orders in a basic e-commerce system.

### **Requirements:**

1. **Endpoint 1:** Create a new order.
   - **Method:** `POST`
   - **URL:** `/orders`
   - **Request Body:**  
   ```json
   {
     "customerId": "123",
     "productIds": ["456", "789"],
     "totalPrice": 99.99
   }
   ```
   - **Response:**  
   ```json
   {
     "orderId": "1",
     "message": "Order successfully created."
   }
   ```

2. **Endpoint 2:** Get all orders.
   - **Method:** `GET`
   - **URL:** `/orders`
   - **Response:**  
   ```json
   [
     {
       "orderId": "1",
       "customerId": "123",
       "productIds": ["456", "789"],
       "totalPrice": 99.99
     }
   ]
   ```

### **Instructions:**
- Use any backend programming language or framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask, Java with Spring Boot, etc.).
- Store the orders in an in-memory array (no need for a database).
- Implement basic error handling (e.g., invalid input for the POST request).
- The code should be clean, well-structured, and easy to understand.

### **Bonus:**
- Add an endpoint to retrieve a specific order by its `orderId`.
- Use a mock external service call (e.g., to simulate checking product availability from another microservice) before an order is placed.

### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Correctness:** Do the endpoints work as expected?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, modular, and well-documented?
- **Error Handling:** How are edge cases and invalid inputs managed?
- **Scalability:** Is the candidate thinking about how the system might scale (even though it’s simple, they might discuss it)?
- **Bonus (optional):** Did the candidate add the bonus endpoint or simulate external service calls?

This test should take no more than an hour to complete and gives insight into the candidate’s basic coding ability, as well as their understanding of backend concepts and microservice interactions.
